						Itâ€™s the cool air in the sun-kissed sky. It's a song
						that takes you back. It's the feeling of returning home.
						Your story is weaved with these moments of memory and
						family and love. Grovefilm is here to tell the story.
						This is our purpose and why we believe that every
						project is an opportunity to create meaning. To relive
						the moments we never want to forget. &mdash; Peter
						Staudinger, Founder.
